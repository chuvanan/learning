# The value of visualization


## Readings

- [Design and Redesign](https://medium.com/@hint_fm/design-and-redesign-4ab77206cf9)

    - The author talk about a form of visualization criticism: redesign as
      criticism.
    - Famous example is Ed. Tufte's critique of Space Shuttle Challenger
    - `Critique by redesign`, as argued by the author, works uniquely well in
      data viz (A movie critic can't remake a movie).
    - A prominent advantage of the approach: â€Šintellectually honest (same data
      is used).
    - Big problem with redesigns is their removal of context (hidden goals and
      contraints).
    - Redesigns face public audience
    - Rules of engagement: maintain rigor (a critic who creates a redesign
      should be explicit about the goal, critics must be honest about any
      simplifying assumptions), respect the designer, respect the critic.
